- 👋 Hi, I’m Vincent Papegay-Vallet, a Telecom Paris first year student (@vincent-pava). 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flask, Django, Javascript, Vue.js, CSS, HTML and many other great technologies !

- ❓ I know this page looks a bit empty, it's because although I have quite a few projects going on I'm still learning to master GitHub and as I was trying to deploy a Flask app on Heroku I realised that I still have a lot to learn about keeping private data 🔒 private on these services, so as long as I've not figured it out (it should be done soon) most projects will remain private, but feel free to contact me if you want to see more 👀
